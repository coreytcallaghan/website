## Our lab's philosophy
We recognize the importance of listening, empathizing, supporting, and amplifying the voices of underrepresented groups. Complex ecological challenges require diverse approaches, people, and solutions, derived from diverse teams. We acknowledge systemic inequities in science and society, and strive to make our research, extension, institution, and society as a whole more equitable and inclusive. It important not to shy away from the issues currently going on not only in ecology and evolution, but also across society. We commit to continually learning and adopting new strategies to conduct ourselves in a meaningful manner with respect to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

### Work-life balance
We strive for a healthy work-life balance, which means ensuring to take time off and reset ourselves.

### Open science
We adopt open science principles and it is expected that data and code gathered as part of the research group are made open-access at the end of the respective project.
