### Our Lab's Philosophy
Our lab is committed to promoting inclusivity, clear communication and collaboration, a supportive work environment, well-defined goals and objectives, flexibility and adaptability, and work-life balance. By fostering these principles, we aim to create a productive research environment that allows our team members to thrive and contribute their best work. We recognize the importance of listening, empathizing, supporting, and amplifying the voices of underrepresented groups. Complex ecological challenges require diverse approaches, people, and solutions, derived from diverse teams. We acknowledge systemic inequities in science and society, and strive to make our research, extension, institution, and society as a whole more equitable and inclusive. It important not to shy away from the issues currently going on not only in ecology and evolution, but also across society. We commit to continually learning and adopting new strategies to conduct ourselves in a meaningful manner with respect to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

#### Work-Life Balance
We believe that work-life balance is essential for maintaining the health and well-being of our team members. We support flexible work arrangements and provide resources and support to help our team members manage their work and personal responsibilities. We also strive to foster a positive work culture that values work-life balance and promotes open communication and collaboration.

#### Open Science
We are committed to the principles of open science, which seeks to make scientific research more transparent, accessible, and reproducible. We support open access, open data, and open source, and we share our research openly and transparently. By promoting open science, we aim to advance scientific knowledge and foster collaboration and innovation within the research community.
