Part of my appointment at UF includes extension.

My extension program focuses on two main components, overlapping with my research:

(1) preserving urban biodiversity with a focus on urban greenspaces; and

(2) increasing engagement by the public in citizen science programs such as iNaturalist, with an emphasis on discovering urban biodiversity.

If you are interested in discussing extension opportunities or would like to discuss further please reach out.
