### Providing scientific knowledge and expertise to the public
Part (30%) of my appointment includes [extension](https://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/who-we-are/about-extension/#:~:text=Extension%20is%20a%20partnership%20between,the%20Florida%20Cooperative%20Extension%20Service.). My extension program focuses on two main components, overlapping with my [research](https://www.coreytcallaghan.com/research/) interests:

(1) increasing public engagement and knowledge about local biodiversity through citizen science platforms; and

(2) empowering educators and facilitators to integrate citizen science in educational settings, both formal and informal.

#### Boosting community involvement in biodiversity through citizen science
This objective is about drawing the public closer to the natural world around them. By tracking engagement in birdwatching, nature walks, and workshops, we aim to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of local biodiversity. Success is measured through increased participation and activity on platforms like iNaturalist, reflecting a genuine boost in public interest and knowledge about our environment. I serve on the organizing committee for the [South Florida City Nature Challenge](https://www.cncsoflo.com/), with a focus on Broward County participation.

#### Equipping educators for citizen science integration
Here, the goal is to empower those in educational roles to weave citizen science into both formal and informal learning environments. Through training sessions and the implementation of activities like bioblitzes, we assess the effectiveness of our programs by the number of educators trained and the subsequent application of their training in fostering engaging learning experiences about biodiversity.


If you are interested in discussing extension opportunities or would like to discuss further please reach out. I'm often available for formal or informal talks and presentations about biodiversity, urban ecology, or citizen science.
