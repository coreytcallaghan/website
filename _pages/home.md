### Welcome!
Welcome to the Global ecology research group at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/), located in the [Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/). Our group studies a wide array of ecological questions focused on better understanding how species respond to anthropogenic changes in the environment. We adopt a multi-taxa approach, integrating large datasets such as those derived from citizen science and remotely-sensed products with quantitative approaches, geospatial analyses, and macroecological theory to understand processes and mechanisms shaping biodiversity. For more details, check out our [research page](https://coreytcallaghan.github.io/website/research/).

We are located at the [Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center](https://flrec.ifas.ufl.edu/) in Davie, Florida.
