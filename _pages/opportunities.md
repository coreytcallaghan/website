We are always excited to discuss the potential of new students (undergraduate, M.S., or PhD) and postdocs.

# Students
If you are a student, please read the description of intake into UF here. Keep in mind we are located in Davie, Florida, and not on the main campus of UF in Gainesville. Nevertheless, feel free to reach out to discuss.

# postdocs
I am keen to work with postdocs to develop research proposals that can support one's own funding. Some examples of independent postdoc funding that are particularly well-suited to apply for include: [Smith Fellowship](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows).

# Visitors
I am also always interested in chatting with individuals about visiting opportunities. For example, the Fulbright fellowship.
