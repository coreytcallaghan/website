In 2021, iNaturalist averaged about 81,000 observations per day. I believe that big biodiversity data (e.g., [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/), and aggregations like [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)) will be fundamental to the future of research in ecology and evolution, enabling ecologists to ask questions about biodiversity patterns at scales that were previously impossible. This is why one part of my research has focused on understanding how these big datasets can be most useful for biodiversity research. For example, I have (1) quantified how citizen science can be used to estimate species richness ([Callaghan et al. 2020](https://www.coreytcallaghan.com/papers/Callaghan_et_al-2020-Citizen%20science%20data%20accurately%20predicts%20expert-derived%20species%20richness.pdf)); (2) developed a novel adaptive sampling framework aimed at collecting better data for biodiversity monitoring ([Callaghan et al. 2019](https://www.coreytcallaghan.com/papers/Callaghan_et_al-2019-Optimizing%20biodiversity%20sampling%20by%20citizen%20scientists.pdf)); and (3) quantified biases in citizen science data that should be accounted for in modelling ([Callaghan et al. 2021](https://www.coreytcallaghan.com/papers/Callaghan_et_al-2021-Large-bodied%20birds%20are%20over-represented%20in%20unstructured%20citizen%20science%20data.pdf)).

My interest in citizen science began from recognizing the importance of the data to answer ecological questions. But each observation represents not only a data point about biodiversity, but a data point about when, and how, someone interacted with nature. I am increasingly interested in this line of work, quantifying how people interact and engage with the natural environment through citizen science. As such, I have a number of ongoing projects and collaborations aimed at understanding why, and how, people contribute to biodiversity citizen science datasets (e.g., [Bowler et al. 2022](https://www.coreytcallaghan.com/papers/Bowler_et_al_2022-Decision-making%20of%20citizen%20scientists.pdf)). Most of this research is with the aim of understanding how to improve modelling of citizen science data for better understanding biodiversity change.
