- name: Jackson Barratt Heitmann
  position: PhD Student
  description: Jackson is a PhD student in the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. He received his Masters from College of Charleston, South Carolina, where he studied ephemeral wetlands and their value for birds. For his PhD, he is continuing to study wetlands, using a combination of data analysis and fieldwork, to understand the value and importance of various types of wetlands, ranging from natural ephemeral wetlands to highly anthropogenic constructed wetlands.

- name: Samantha Lowe
  position: Master's Student
  description: Sam is a Master's Student in the School of Natural Resources and Environment. She is working on understanding and quantifying how, and why, people engage with nature through citizen science using the iNaturalist project as a case study. She also is assessing the complementarity of citizen science data such as eBird and iNaturalist with state agency data.

- name: Muzi D. Sibiya
  position: Postdoctoral Associate
  description: Muzi is a postdoc in our group. He is a recent graduate from the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation with a PhD, where he focused on assesssing long-term changes in bird communities and mixed species behavior in Afircan savannas. Currently, he is working on modelling abundance of Wild Turkey by integrating disparate datasets, including citizen science data. His responsibilities in the group involve conducting quantitative analysis, writing associated scientific papers, and providing support for graduate students and team members.

- name: Levi Hoskins
  position: Incoming PhD student
  description: Levi is an incoming PhD student in the School of Natural Resources and Environment and will be working on a PhD in interdisciplinary ecology. They received their bachelor's from Tulane University where they studied habitat fragmentation in the Chocó Rainforest of Ecuador. During their PhD, they will study how urban greenspaces are used by humans and migratory animals. By integrating citizen science data and fieldwork, they will study how these areas influence migration patterns and species abundance. Levi is co-supervised with Dr. Chang Zhao from the Department of Agronomy.
